# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The WTWR (What to Wear) back-end project is designed to provide a robust server infrastructure for the WTWR application. This server manages clothing items, user profiles, and user interactions, allowing users to add, delete, and like clothing items. It features a RESTful API with user authorization and leverages technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose. The project showcases database management, and testing protocols.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
